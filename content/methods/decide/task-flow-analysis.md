  title: Task flow analysis
  what: A step-by-step analysis of how a user will interact with a system in order to reach a goal. This analysis is documented in a diagram that traces a user's possible paths through sequences of tasks and decision points in pursuit of their goal. The tasks and decision points should represent steps taken by the user, as well as steps taken by the system.
  why: To validate a design team's understanding of users' goals, common scenarios, and tasks, and to illustrate in a solution-agnostic way the overall flow of tasks through which a user progresses to accomplish a goal.  Task flow diagrams also help surface obstacles in the way of users achieving their goal.
  timeRequired: 2-3 hours per user goal
