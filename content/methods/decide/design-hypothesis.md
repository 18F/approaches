  title: Design hypothesis
  what: |
    <p>Framing your work as a hypothesis means no longer just thinking about the thing you're making or building, but paying more attention to whether that work is achieving your intended goals and outcomes.</p>

    <p>This in turn means thinking about your work as a series of experiments you do with your users to learn if you're on the right path. Instead of asking "Did we ship the shopping cart feature?" you ask: "Did we make it easier and simpler for our customers to buy from us?"</p>
  why: When done collaboratively, hypothesis-building is powerful at getting a team on the same page about what it’s doing and why. It also allows the team to be flexible &mdash; if one approach doesn’t result in the outcome you expected, you have implicit permission to change course and try something else.
