  title: User stories
  what: A short, plain-language description of a product feature or requirement written from the perspective of the user.
  why: To frame the problem we’re solving around the needs of the people who will use the product, rather than the program or agency overseeing it. User stories also help us break down a large development effort into smaller, more manageable slices so that we can track progress, plan sprints, and prioritize work around user impact. They encourage us to talk about features in plain language and make the discussions (and solutions) more accessible.
  timeRequired: 1-2 hours per epic

## How to do it{#how-user-stories}

1. Gather any documents that describe the different use cases or [scenarios]({{ "/methods/decide/user-scenarios/" | url }}) in which users will interact with your service.
1. Start by defining the project’s [epics](https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/glossary/#epic){.usa-link .usa-link--external} – typically the larger, high-level “themes” or bodies of work that make up the initiative.
1. Break down each epic into pieces of work that can be independently estimated, developed, and tested. These will become your user stories.
    <p>
      <em>Tip: Make this process easier by using stickies or an online whiteboard tool.</em>
    </p>
1. For each piece of work you identified, write the actual user story from the user’s perspective. User stories typically follow this template:
    <p>
      <b><em>As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some outcome >.</em></b>
    </p>
1. Consider possible harms to the user, the system, or external to the system by adding a second part of the sentence:
    <p>
      <b><em>…while avoiding < potential negative impacts > to < the user, the system, or external to the system >.</em></b>
    </p>
1. For each user story you create, include a short description and list the acceptance criteria, or conditions necessary to consider the user story “done.” Where possible, include a rough size estimate for high-level scoping purposes.
