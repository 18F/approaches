  what: Written statements, generally in the form of imperatives like "Earn people's trust," that serve as guiding lights during decision-making.
  why: To give the team and the stakeholders a shared point of reference when negotiating next steps. Good design principles are specific to the project, not general truths, and should help teams say "no" to otherwise interesting proposals or generate ideas when they're stuck.
  timeRequired: 1 week, plus occasional refresher meetings
