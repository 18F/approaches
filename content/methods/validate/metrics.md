  title: Metrics setting
  what: How to measure the success of a prototype.
  why: To know if your prototype is successful, you need to define the outcomes you hope it achieves. You also need to define metrics to know if it's achieving them.
  timeRequired: 2-3 hours to brainstorm and select metrics. <br> Length of prototype run to collect data.

## How to do it{#how-to-metrics}

1. Define the desired outcomes for your prototype. Invite stakeholders to brainstorm. Your outcomes may be based on your [design hypothesis]({{ "/methods/decide/design-hypothesis/" | url }}).
1. List ways to measure whether your prototype is achieving those outcomes. Consider quantitative and qualitative metrics:
    1. Quantitative metrics are numerical indicators.
    1. Qualitative metrics capture subjective feedback and insights.
1. Determine how you will collect data for each metric. This could involve user testing, surveys, analytics tools, and/or interviews.
1. Choose metrics that are most effective yet easiest to measure. 
1. Plan who will be responsible for data collection and how often metrics will be reviewed.
1. Establish benchmarks for each metric. These may be based on industry standards, historical data, or your desired outcomes.
1. Implement the prototype. Start collecting data based on your measurement plan. 
1. Analyze the results against your benchmarks. Identify strengths and areas of improvement. Iterate the prototype and refine metrics if necessary.

## Considerations for use in government{#con-metrics}

Surveys of more than 9 people require PRA approval. Learn more at PRA.Digital.gov. Direct observation and non-standardized conversations like semi-structured [interviews]({{ "/methods/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/" | url }})) are not subject to PRA.  

Additionally, be mindful that your prototype may not be the only effort being tested. People may be overwhelmed by the amount of data they’re asked to provide. Finding metrics that can be automatically collected can help relieve this burden.
