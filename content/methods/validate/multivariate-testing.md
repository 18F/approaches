  title: Multivariate testing
  what: A test of variations to multiple sections or features of a page to see which combination of variants has the greatest effect. Different from an A/B test, which tests variation to just one section or feature.
  why: To incorporate different contexts, channels, or user types into addressing a user need. Situating a call to action, content section, or feature set differently can help you build a more effective whole solution from a set of partial solutions.
  timeRequired: 2–5 days of effort, 1–4 weeks elapsed through the testing period
