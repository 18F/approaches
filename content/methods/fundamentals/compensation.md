  what: Offering usability test or user research participants compensation to encourage participation and to thank them for their time.
  why: Compensating participants for sharing their time and lived experience with your team often results in a more diverse, representative set of participants. Without compensation, you often end up recruiting people with a strong intrinsic interest in your website. These people may not have the same needs and experiences as a less interested pool of users. With compensation, you can encourage less interested, more representative people to participate.
