  what: A rudimentary version, either static or functional, of something that exhibits realistic form and function.
  why: |
    To enable direct examination of a design concept’s viability with a number of other methods such as <a href="https://guides.18f.gov/methods/validate/usability-testing/" class="usa-link">usability testing</a> or a <a href="https://guides.18f.gov/methods/discover/cognitive-walkthrough/" class="usa-link">cognitive walkthrough</a>. Static prototypes (often paper) are helpful for gaining feedback on users’ intentions and various design elements. Functional prototypes (often coded) are helpful for observing how users interact with the product.
