<p class="chapter-summary">Understanding the benefits and risks of commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) and custom software will help government agencies choose a solution appropriate to their needs.</p>

A major reason that government technology projects fail or struggle is that government agencies often approach obtaining software as a matter of building *or* buying it. The reality is more complex. 

Many custom-built software systems are composed partly of commercially available products and services (cloud hosting, for instance). Meanwhile, agencies frequently buy commercial software products and then spend additional funds customizing them to suit their specific needs. 

A government technology system is almost always a mixture of commercial *and* custom parts. This complexity requires *building thoughtfully and buying differently* than has been done in the past. It’s critical to consider the costs and benefits of commercial products and custom development. One should ask: “Can we buy this piece of the system without having to customize it?” And: “If we build a custom piece of software, how do we ensure it is delivered on time, on budget, and satisfies our users?”

Understanding the benefits and risks of the options, and when each is appropriate, is necessary to answering those questions and setting your project up for success.

## Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) software

In plain language, [**commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS)**]({{'https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-2.1\#FAR\_2\_101\_\_d75e451' | url}}) means software that is sold to the government in the same form it’s sold to any other consumer.

COTS software is designed to do specific things and is *configured* to meet your organization’s needs and preferences. **Configuration** of COTS software means making changes to the product’s available “out of the box” settings. For example, types of configuration include changing the layout of your email inbox or deciding if a field appears on a form by turning options on or off. Configuration changes don’t require **customization**, which is when *a developer modifies the product’s code base to meet your needs.* 

### Some background on COTS software and its benefits

COTS software, like other commercial items, products, and services, is promoted and mandated for use at the federal level to the “maximum extent practicable” thanks to two laws: the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 ([Public Law No. 103–259]({{'https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/senate-bill/1587/text' | url}})) and the Clinger Cohen Act of 1996 ([Public Law No. 104–106]({{'https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/senate-bill/1124/text' | url}})). The federal government’s shift towards commercial offerings influenced many state and local governments as well. Along with the rise of the internet, these laws changed how the government could buy information technology. They made commercial items like COTS software exempt from the more rigorous procurement processes the government uses to evaluate products and services. 

The rationale for these changes was that the pressures of a competitive market were expected to keep costs low and quality high for consumers. That’s worked well for physical objects, but software is an inherently different kind of product with a different life cycle. This essential difference is the source of the government’s risk when acquiring software from the commercial market.

### When to choose COTS

COTS is the right choice for meeting a need that *many* other buyers have, like email. An agency could develop its own email system, but it would be a waste of time, money, and effort since existing COTS email systems come with a wide array of features and functions that any buyer can use to meet its needs.
