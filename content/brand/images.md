## Representing humans
In order to offer more diverse and expressive ways to represent humans, we created a custom set of [Open Peeps](https://www.openpeeps.com/) based on the work of Pablo Stanley. These are great for showing emotion and to represent anonymous user groups.

These are available to GSA staff in two formats:
* Via the [starter deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fAzoUwkfKAS2hy4YkqjHLqSQa_rvqiUyFpgACq6tRpY/edit#slide=id.g2efd29ee28c_0_0), which includes several character sets and a range of emotions as well as guidance on different ways to represent humans.
* Via the [full Figma library](https://www.figma.com/design/sA9t0Msi5Ycvx5ITVMJylU/18F_Open_Peeps_Mainfile?node-id=2328-21896&t=qWFSkRL1ga6yHdnO-0) for designers.
