## How to do it

1. As a team, identify and make explicit the problem you’re trying to solve. What goals or needs aren’t being met? What measurable criteria would indicate progress toward those goals?
1. As a team, write out the hypothesis for the work you want to do to address the problem(s) you’re trying to solve. You may want to write broad hypotheses at the outset of a project and more specific hypotheses each sprint.
    <br/>Here’s a common way to structure your hypothesis:

    - *We believe that doing/building/creating [this] for [this user] will result in [this outcome].*
    - *We’ll know we’re right when we see [this metric/signal].*

1. Once you've formulated your hypothesis, consider the following harm prompt to help the team think about and guard against potential unintended consequences of your work.
    - *But, this could be harmful for [this user] if [this outcome happens].*

1. Identify a user touchpoint that will allow you to test your hypothesis, such as external marketing, the homepage, a microsite, or something else. Test your hypothesis. If you learn something unexpected, refine your hypothesis, test again, and continue to work incrementally towards your goals.
