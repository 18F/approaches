## How to do it

1. Give meeting participants two minutes to write what they would like to talk about on sticky notes (one idea per sticky note)
1. Have meeting participants review the topics generated and [dot vote]({{ "/methods/discover/dot-voting/" | url }}) on the topics they are most interested in
1. Decide how much time will be spent talking about each topic
1. Start with the topic that got the most votes
1. At the end of the allotted time, have meeting participants vote:
    - Thumbs up: Continue talking about the topic for a shorter set amount of time
    - Thumbs down: Move to the next topic

This method provides structure to these meetings and ensures topics are democratically selected for conversation.
